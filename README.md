Howdy! My name is Jake Arnett and I'm a Software Developer. I find deep satisfaction in solving problems and continually growing by learning and meeting new people. 

Most of my professional career has been in the world of audio. I've worked on broadcast teams for live sports, prescribed hearing instruments, assisted corporate events and meetings, and even have worked on several tv shows and movies. While I was passionate about my work in sound, I knew I wanted to take my knack for troubleshoot and creativity to different field. 

I started learning to code on my own through freecodecamp and tutorials on youtube. I knew I want to learn more and grow my passion for programming into my future career. My next step into the world of tech was joining Commonwealth Coders, a web development bootcamp seeking to train individuals in rural areas for future tech roles. After graduating Commonwealth Coders I wanted to take my knowledge and skills to the next level. I decided to enroll with Tech Elevator in Cincinnati to further develop my skills as a Full Stack Developer. 

While working through Tech Elevator I am seeking roles as a Software Developer where I can work on a team centered in positivity, inclusivity, and growth. Please feel free to send me a message if you'd like to talk tech, programming, trivia, sneakers, or A Bear Called Paddington.
